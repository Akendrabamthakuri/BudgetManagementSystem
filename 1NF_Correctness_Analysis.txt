SAJILO YATRA - 1NF CORRECTNESS ANALYSIS

=== YOUR PROVIDED 1NF ===
TRIP_1NF (
    Trip_ID, Trip_Date, Departure_Time, Arrival_Time, Trip_Status, Last_Change_Date,
    Route_ID, Route_Name, Start_City, End_City, Distance,
    Bus_ID, Bus_Registration, Bus_Capacity, Bus_Availability,
    Staff_ID, Staff_Name, Staff_Number, Role, Assigned_From, Assigned_To,
    Booking_ID, Passenger_ID, Passenger_Name, Date_of_Birth, Email, Phone_Number,
    Luggage_Requirements, Travel_Notifications, Booking_Class, Booking_Date, Booking_Status,
    Ticket_ID, Ticket_Fare, Ticket_Issue_Date,
    Payment_ID, Payment_Amount, Payment_Date, Payment_Method,
    PRIMARY KEY (Trip_ID, Staff_ID, Booking_ID, Ticket_ID, Payment_ID)
)

=== ANALYSIS RESULT ===

❌ **THIS IS NOT PROPER 1NF**

=== MAJOR PROBLEMS ===

1. **WRONG APPROACH TO 1NF**
   - 1NF should SEPARATE repeating groups into different relations
   - You've kept everything in ONE massive relation
   - This creates a Cartesian product nightmare

2. **PROBLEMATIC PRIMARY KEY**
   - 5-attribute composite key is unwieldy
   - NULLs in key attributes (Staff_ID, Booking_ID can be NULL)
   - Primary keys cannot contain NULLs

3. **DATA REDUNDANCY ISSUES**
   - Trip, Route, Bus data repeated for every staff/booking combination
   - Massive storage waste and update anomalies

4. **NULL VALUE PROBLEMS**
   - "NULL if row represents booking only" violates key constraints
   - Creates sparse, inefficient storage

=== CORRECT 1NF APPROACH ===

1NF should create SEPARATE relations:

**TRIP** (Trip_ID, Trip_Date, Departure_Time, Arrival_Time, Trip_Status, Last_Change_Date, Route_ID, Route_Name, Start_City, End_City, Distance, Bus_ID, Bus_Registration, Bus_Capacity, Bus_Availability)
- Primary Key: Trip_ID

**TRIP_STAFF** (Trip_ID, Staff_ID, Staff_Name, Staff_Number, Role, Assigned_From, Assigned_To)
- Primary Key: (Trip_ID, Staff_ID)

**TRIP_BOOKING** (Trip_ID, Booking_ID, Passenger_ID, Passenger_Name, Date_of_Birth, Email, Phone_Number, Luggage_Requirements, Travel_Notifications, Booking_Class, Booking_Date, Booking_Status)
- Primary Key: (Trip_ID, Booking_ID)

**TRIP_TICKET** (Trip_ID, Ticket_ID, Booking_ID, Ticket_Fare, Ticket_Issue_Date)
- Primary Key: (Trip_ID, Ticket_ID)

**TRIP_PAYMENT** (Trip_ID, Payment_ID, Ticket_ID, Payment_Amount, Payment_Date, Payment_Method)
- Primary Key: (Trip_ID, Payment_ID)

=== WHY YOUR APPROACH IS WRONG ===

1. **1NF Definition**: "Eliminate repeating groups by creating separate relations"
   - You kept everything in one relation

2. **Atomicity**: Each cell should contain single values
   - Your approach creates complex, sparse rows

3. **Key Integrity**: Primary keys cannot have NULLs
   - Your composite key allows NULLs

=== CORRECT 1NF PRINCIPLES ===

✅ Separate relations for each entity/relationship
✅ Atomic values in each cell
✅ No repeating groups
✅ Proper primary keys without NULLs
✅ Carry forward foreign keys

=== VERDICT ===

Your approach is **INCORRECT for 1NF**. 

1NF requires DECOMPOSITION into multiple relations, not keeping everything in one massive table with NULLs.

The correct 1NF should have 5 separate relations as shown above.
